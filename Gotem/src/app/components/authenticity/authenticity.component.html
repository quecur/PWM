               <p>
                    Our team goes through the construction from the outside to the inside. 
                    We analyze everything from Stiching to the materials. 
                    The shoe is also checked under a black light.

                <p>
                    We look through the shoes for wear and tear, both the shoe and box is checked. 
                    We mostly sell deadstock items, but also allow the options for people to sell their used shoes at our in-store location, if we find it suitable for our store. 
                    If a shoe is used, it will affect the pricing, and you will see the tag "used".
